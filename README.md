# Vision Transformer (ViT) Project

## Overview

This project implements a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for image classification tasks using PyTorch. The ViT model breaks down an image into patches, embeds each patch with learnable embeddings, and processes them through multiple Transformer Encoder blocks. The classification head is added on top of the final embedding output.

## Components

- **Patch Embedding:** Converts image patches into embeddings.
- **Position Embedding:** Adds positional information to the patch embeddings.
- **Multi-head Self-Attention Block:** Captures global dependencies between patches.
- **MLP Block:** Applies feedforward transformation to each patch independently.
- **Transformer Encoder:** Stacks multiple self-attention and MLP blocks for feature extraction.
- **Classifier Head:** Makes predictions based on the final embedding.

## Training

- **Data Preparation:** Loads and preprocesses image data.
- **Model Training:** Trains the ViT model using Adam optimizer and CrossEntropyLoss.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates model performance on test data.

## Results

- **Training Curves:** Visualizes loss curves during training.
- **Model Deployment:** Saves the trained ViT model for deployment.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different ViT variants (e.g., ViT-Large, ViT-Huge).
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
- Explore transfer learning with pre-trained ViT models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation and training of a Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification tasks using PyTorch, providing insights into its architecture and training process.
